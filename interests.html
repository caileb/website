<li>As I said before I am really into languages. I love learning new ones and learning about the culture that surrounds them. I hope to learn Arabic to fluency, and I am fairly close to that in German, but I still have some more learning to do. I would like ot get a job that would involves uses of those languages after I graduate. I am also interesting in the restaurant industry due to my family owning several restaurants in my hometown. I've worked at them and think that owning them one day would be pretty cool. I enjoy track and field and ended up winning States for javelin last year. I'll be continuing track at UMaine. </li>
